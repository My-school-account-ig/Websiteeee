            <h1>Welcome to my about me!</h1>
            <p> Wanted this to look like it came from the 1990-2000's xd </p>
            <p> Anyways, welcome to my about me page! </p>
            <p> I'm a 13 year old person (not sharing my gender yet ;3) who likes to code ig? </p>
            <p> I've created all these websites using pure html and JS (javascript), like this one! (Without the javascript xd) </p>
            <p> I'm also creating a website for my business (my dad dosen't like the one we have rn so...) </p>
            <p> I actually haven't started on it yet but I will do soon! </p>
            <p> And because I don't actually want to pay for a web hosting service, every thing will have to be done through "github.io" </p>
            <p> And I'm also creating Snake! </p>
            <a href="/WIP.html" target="_self"> Link for it here! </a>
            <p> I'm also creating a roblox game with my friend </p>
            <p> And I'm also (trying to) create my own OS!</p>
            <p> Not going so quick as I'm new to C and asm... 3:</p>
            <p> But it will be coming out some time next year (or maybe this year! Who knows? :shrug:) </p>
            <p> Anyways that's enough about me! </p>
            <p> Bye! </p>
